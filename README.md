Written in Swift. All classes, including audio player and metadata classes are written using Apple's APIs, without helper frameworks. Developed with an emphasis on reducing duplicate code in a cross-platform iOS/tvOS/watchOS app, for example, WVBUMetadataManager.swift is shared between all three platforms.

Developed in spring 2016 as part of an independent study at Bucknell University.
